# CustomFileExplorer

## A custom file explorer written C-sharp

This is my very basic implementation of a custom file explorer in C#. It allows users to browse through their files and directories, create new folders, copy/paste/cut/rename files and folders, and delete files and folders.

I will expand it in the future to include more features. For now it's just a playground for me to learn and practice C# and its capabilities.
